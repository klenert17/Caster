## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The dimensions of the mount are 120 mm x 120 mm square with a 25 mm circle in the center and 4 10 mm circles in the corners. The exctrusion is 8 mm.

### Reflection

I had some trouble with this because I had it exctruded originaly, but the directions were telling me to do something different. I eventually figured it out by doing what I had origianly did which was the basic extrude set up. Putting the 6 holes through was also hard but I eventually got it after ajusting it a bunch.

I leaned how to build on to of an extrusion, and how to change the colors of things.

## Fork

### Description

The dimensions of this are a 80 mm circle with a 8 mm extrusion with 2 75 mm forks that are 40 mm x 5 mm and 15 mm up-wards and down-wards from the center. Then on the corners of the forks are 15 mm fillets and on all of theedges are 1 mm fillets. On the base of the forks are 4 mm fillets. In the center of the forks are 10 mm circle holes. On the other side there is a shaft that is 5 mm thick and its inner edge is 15 mm and outer is 20 mm.

### Reflection

This was the hardest for me to build because I could not figure out how to build the second fork. I figured out that I was putting my sketches on the front plane, insted of on top of the cylinder base. Once I figured this out I used it a lot in the future. 
I learned how to sketch ontop of an extrusion, and I got better at using the mirroring tool.

## Tire

### Description

the dimension of this tire can be found [here](https://cvilleschools.instructure.com/courses/31052/assignments/278961?module_item_id=874016)

### Reflection

The tire was confusing at the beginning because I thought I needed more dimensions, but turns out I didn't! Eveerything fell into place, I just needed to keep working at it.

## Wheel

### Description

How to make this can be found	[here](https://cvilleschools.instructure.com/courses/31052/assignments/258606?module_item_id=797162), but the dimensions are a 20 mm x 5 mm rectangle on top, then a 5 mm x 35 mm rectangle below, then a 12.5 mm x 20 mm at the bottom. Then you use the revolve tool.

This was very easy becasue the video linked above was very helpful. I learned how to use circular patterns.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description

2 cicles, 6 mm 10 mm. Then extrude by 60 mm.Then press Use and seclect the outer edge. Then extrude remove 10 mm a line that is 4.5 mm from the center point on the circle. Then feture mirron on the front plane. Then add a 15 mm and a equal circle on the end and extrude 10 mm.Then create a hole on the collar that is 3 mm.

I learned how to make different parts not connect and how to use the "use" tool.

## Wheel and Axle Assembly

### Description

Using fasten mates I first connected the wheel with the tire, then I connected two bearings to the wheel, then put my axle through the center of my wheel. 	[This video goes into further depth](https://youtu.be/R4PDBd8H5h8)

### Reflection

I enforced and used my knowlage on using the fasten mate tool, and this really helped me connect the parts in the way I wanted it to.

## Final Caster Assembly

### Description

Using my knowlage on fasten and revolute mates, I connected all of the parts I made. I connected the wheel to the mount, the mount to the base, etc. and added screws. 	[This video goes into further depth](https://youtu.be/orcp-asikM4)

### Reflection

I used everything I had learned and created the final product. This project was challanging at some parts, but I just kept picking at it until it worked. This was a fun project.
